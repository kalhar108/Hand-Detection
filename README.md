# Hand-Detection

A lightweight Python project for real-time hand tracking and interaction using computer vision. It leverages webcam input to detect hands and extract landmarks for gesture-based control or monitoring.

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental hand tracking capabilities: it includes modules for detecting hand landmarks, tracking hand position, and integrating gesture controls (for example, volume control) via those landmarks. The focus is on using readily available libraries to build a working prototype of hand-based interaction.

## Features

* Real-time hand landmark detection using webcam feed (`HandTrackingModule.py`)
* Gesture-based control module (`VolumeHandControl.py`) demonstrating how hand position or gestures map to actions
* Modular design: separation between landmark detection vs. gesture control logic
* Easy to run prototype, suitable for experimentation with hand gestures and UI/interaction use cases

## Tech Stack

* **Python** as the implementation language
* **OpenCV** for video capture and frame processing
* **MediaPipe** (implied by usage of hand-landmark modules) for landmark detection
* Custom control logic in `VolumeHandControl.py` for mapping gestures to actions (e.g., volume change)
* Webcam as the input device; real-time processing intended
* Minimal external dependencies, making it lightweight and accessible

## Repository Structure

├─ HandTrackingModule.py       # Module for detecting and tracking hand landmarks  
├─ VolumeHandControl.py        # Module that uses hand landmarks for gesture-based control

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system
* Webcam attached and accessible
* Basic familiarity with running Python scripts in terminal/console

### Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalhar108/Hand-Detection.git
cd Hand-Detection

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
# or venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies if a requirements file exists
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the hand-tracking module:

   ```bash
   python HandTrackingModule.py
   ```

   You will see webcam feed with detected hand landmarks and possibly frames indicating hand position.

2. Run the gesture control module:

   ```bash
   python VolumeHandControl.py
   ```

   The script will map detected gestures or hand positions to control actions (for example, adjusting volume) — use as a demo of interactive hand control.

## How it Works (High-Level Flow)

1. The webcam feed is captured frame-by-frame via OpenCV.
2. Hand landmarks are detected (via MediaPipe or similar) in each frame.
3. The landmark data (e.g., fingertip positions) are passed into control logic to interpret gestures.
4. Based on gesture detection, the system issues corresponding actions (e.g., volume up/down, pointer movement).
5. The result is superimposed onto the video feed for visualization.

## Design Highlights

* Separation between detection logic (`HandTrackingModule.py`) and control logic (`VolumeHandControl.py`) makes it easy to extend.
* Real-time operation: designed for webcam input and immediate feedback.
* Light-weight: relies on Python and common vision libraries without heavy deep-learning training loops.
* Practical demo of how hand tracking can be used for gesture-controlled interactions.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements include:

* Add support for multiple simultaneous hands / fingers and gestures (e.g., pinch, rotate)
* Integrate deeper gesture recognition (e.g., counting fingers, sign language)
* Build a UI or Dashboard for customizing gesture-action mappings
* Optimize performance for full HD or higher refresh rates
* Package as a library or module for integration into larger applications
* Add unit/integration tests and deploy to an embedded/edge device (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
